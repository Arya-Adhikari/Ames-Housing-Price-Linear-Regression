Ames Housing Price Prediction
This project demonstrates how to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa using a linear regression model. The dataset contains various features related to homes (e.g., square footage, year built, number of bathrooms) and the target variable is the sale price.

Requirements
Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy

Overview
The project follows the typical data science pipeline:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-Loading the dataset and understanding the structure.
-Cleaning the data (handling missing values, formatting).
-Visualizing the data through heatmaps, scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to explore relationships between variables.
-Feature Engineering:
  Selecting relevant features based on correlation with the target variable SalePrice.
  Dropping irrelevant columns to keep the model focused on important features.
-Modeling:
  Splitting the data into training and test sets.
-Training a Linear Regression model using the selected features.
-Evaluating the model using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.

Visualization:
-Visualizing actual vs. predicted prices using scatter plots.
-Visualizing the relationships between selected features and the target variable using scatter plots and histograms with fitted normal distributions.

How to Use
Load the Data: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named AmesHousing.csv. Replace the file path with the correct path on your system.

train = pd.read_csv(r"C:\path\to\AmesHousing.csv")

Data Preprocessing:
The columns are cleaned by converting them to lowercase and removing spaces.
Missing values are handled, and only the most relevant features for prediction are retained.

Model Training:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
A Linear Regression model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.

Model Evaluation:
After predictions are made, evaluation metrics like RMSE and R-squared are computed.

Visualization:
Various visualizations are created to better understand the dataset and the model's performance. These include:
Correlation heatmaps.
Boxplots and histograms.
Scatter plots comparing actual vs predicted prices.

Results
The model evaluation will provide two key metrics:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Indicates the average magnitude of the errors in predictions.
R-squared (RÂ²): Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable (SalePrice).

Example Output
Mean squared error: <value>
R-squared score: <value>
Example Visualizations:
Actual vs Predicted House Prices:
A scatter plot that shows the predicted prices against the actual prices.

Feature Distributions:

Boxplots and histograms with normal distribution overlays for each feature and the target variable (SalePrice).

Correlation Heatmap:

A heatmap of the correlations between selected features and the target variable.

Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how simple features can be used to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa. The linear regression model performs adequately, though further improvements can be made by exploring more sophisticated models or feature engineering techniques.
